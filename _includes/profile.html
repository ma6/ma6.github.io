            I am an Experience Strategist and Product Manager for digital products and services. I have a focus in design strategy, using tools like personas, scenarios, customer journeys, business model and value proposition canvas etc. to create a product vision. After that, I take the results as an input into delivery where I would write user stories from a customer and experience perspective. I am a Professional Scrum Product Owner and Professional Scrum Master.</p>
        <p>With my strategic way of thinking and my work experience in product and program management, I bring a mix of design and content-related work with project management and customer service.
